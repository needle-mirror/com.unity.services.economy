## Economy Authoring

This package supports deployments thanks to its integration with the [Deployment package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.services.deployment@latest).

As a result, Economy assets can be created, modified, and uploaded from the Editor.

For more information, read the full [documentation](./Authoring/index.md).

> NOTE: The [UGS CLI](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/overview/manual/ugs-cli-introduction) also supports Economy
> files and enable the same workflow as the one described in this document.
